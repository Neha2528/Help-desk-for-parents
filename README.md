Here Attendance can be marked by the student also can be viewed by the parents
Many times manually attendance marking by the teacher calling every student's name consumes most of the time. So to reduce the burden off teacher. Let us say that a lecture is going on and sessions last 5 mins is given to mark the attendance by the student in the supervision of the teacher. Every student has  his college's domain id given to them. And the excel sheet's link will be linked in the website itself. The students have to login using their domain id and mark their attendance according to the subject.
